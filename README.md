# 0h-h1
This is a project attempting to copy the mobile game, 0h h1.
It is a small game about filling in squares based on a set of rules.

The rules are as follows:
1. There are rows and collumns of squares each with the same number of squares that is even numbered.
For instance you may have a 6x6 where there are 6 rows with 6 columns.

2. There are two colors that you will fill these rows and columns with.

3. Rows and columns must have an equal number of each color

4. Two colors may be next to each other but never more than three touching

5. No row or column may repeat

Hopefully, there will be a game that explains this better
